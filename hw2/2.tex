\section*{Problem 2}
 (15 points) What does Trusted Solaris placing system executables at \texttt{ADMIN\_LOW} prevent? Why is this important?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

\texttt{ADMIN\_LOW} allows any label to dominate it.
This means that any processes can read it, but not write.
This prevents common shared files(executables, shared libraries, configurations, etc.) from being accidentally modified but guaranteed that anyone can read it.
