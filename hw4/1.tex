\section*{Problem 1}
(25 points) Suppose composite machine \textit{catdog} (see Section 9.4.1) receives no HIGH inputs. 
Does it emit the same value from the left and the right? 
If so, prove it; if not, give a counterexample.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

It will be the same.

\begin{proof}

    As described by Figure 9-6. 
    The output of \textit{cat} depends on the machines HIGH input, which we know is none; and \textit{dog}'s HIGH output.
    However, \textit{dog}'s output further depends on \textit{cat}'s HIGH output.
    Essencially \textit{dog}'s HIGH output and \textit{cat}'s HIGH output forms a loop.
    Without proper activation(\textit{cat}'s HIGH input), this loop is not activated.

    Therefore, we can conclude that there is no HIGH input going into either machine, which leads to both giving a LOW output of 0.

\end{proof}
