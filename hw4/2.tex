\section*{Problem 2}
(25 points) Consider again the algorithm in Figure 9â€“7. 
The power used is another side channel for most instantiations of this algorithm. 
Explain how this side channel works. 
How might you add sufficient noise to it to render it unusable?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The power used is (almost) linear to $k$, i.e. the time multiplication is executed.
The attacker can measure the power used of this loop to get a general idea of what $k$ is.

To render this attack useless, we fix the loop.
Given an upper bound of $z$, say $z < 2^K$, we always repeat the loop for $K$ times.
Therefore, the power used will be the same no matter $z$.
