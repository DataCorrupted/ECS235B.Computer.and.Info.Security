\section*{Problem 2}
(25 points) Consider again the algorithm in Figure 9â€“7. 
The power used is another side channel for most instantiations of this algorithm. 
Explain how this side channel works. 
How might you add sufficient noise to it to render it unusable?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The power is $z$, so the loop is executed at most $\log_2 z$ times. 
Since the execution time and $\log_2 z$ is approximately linear.
The attacker can measure the execution time of this loop to get a general idea of what $z$ is.

To render this attack useless, we fix the loop time.
Given an upper bound of $z$, say $z < 2^K$, we always repeat the loop for $K$ times.
