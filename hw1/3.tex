\section*{Problem 3}

(29 points) Theorem 3.1, used in the proof of Theorem 3.1, states: 
``Suppose two subjects s1 and s2 are created and the rights in $A[s1, o1]$ and $A[s2, o2]$ are tested. The same test for $A[s1, o1]$ and $A[s1, o2] = A[s1, o2] \cup A[s2, o2]$ will produce the same result.''
Justify this statement. 
Would it be true if one could test for the absence of rights as well as for the presence of rights?
