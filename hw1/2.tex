\section*{Problem 2}
(21 points) Suppose Alice has r and w rights over the file book. Alice wants to copy r rights to book to Bob.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Assuming there is a copy right c, write a command to do this.
    \item Now assume the system supports a copy flag; for example, the right r with the copy flag would be written as rc. In this case, write a command to do the copy.
    \item In the previous part, what happens if the copy flag is not copied?
\end{enumerate}
