\section*{Problem 5}
(25 points) Modify the two-bit system in the first example in Section 9.3 as follows. 
Whenever a HIGH operation is performed, the HIGH state bit is output. 
Whenever a LOW operation is performed, the LOW state bit is output. The initial state is not output (in contrast to the example). 
Is this version of the two-bit system noninterference secure with respect to Lucy? Why or why not?
