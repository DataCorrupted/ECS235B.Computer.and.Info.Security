\section*{Problem 5}
(25 points) Modify the two-bit system in the first example in Section 9.3 as follows. 
Whenever a HIGH operation is performed, the HIGH state bit is output. 
Whenever a LOW operation is performed, the LOW state bit is output. 
The initial state is not output (in contrast to the example). 
Is this version of the two-bit system noninterference secure with respect to Lucy? Why or why not?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

Yes. It is noninterference.

When a command and the output is only performed on its permission, the other permission can't see anything here.
Simply put, the two-bit system gets divided into two seperated machines, therefore they can't interference with each other.

In the example of Lucy and Holly. 
Lucy only sees 0111, no matter how Holly changes her command, Lucy's output won't change.
