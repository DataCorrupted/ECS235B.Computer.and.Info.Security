\section*{Problem 4}
(25 points) The system plugh has users Skyler, Matt, and David. 
Skyler cannot access David’s files, and neither Skyler nor David can access Matt’s files. 
The system xyzzy has users Holly, Sage, and Heidi. 
Sage cannot access either Holly’s or Heidi’s files.

Apply the Principles of Autonomy and Security to determine who can read whose files in the composition of xyzzy and plugh.
