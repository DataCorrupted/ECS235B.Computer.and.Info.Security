\section*{Problem 3}

(10 points) With the exception of the break-the-glass policy model, the hybrid modes we have studied do not discuss availability. 
What unstated assumptions about that service are they making?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

They are assuming that the resource is always avaliable.

While this is not always the case, they generally holds true in the specific problems each model tries to address:

For example, Chinese wall model tries to tackle conflict of interest. Therefore, it assumed the limited number of the clients and thus the data is avaliable to all users.
DRM scheme more focused on digital copyright management. While the user base can be large, the availability problem can be easily solved using Content Distributing Network (CDN) or similar technologies.
